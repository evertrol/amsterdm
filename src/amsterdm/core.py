    The remaining data are seen as the background. It takes the

    standard deviation from the non-smoothed data for this selection
    of indices; this is used as a first estimate for the background
    value and its noise.

    It then finds all values in the smoothed data that are `kappa`
    times noise above the background. The relevant indices are
    combined into sections, and each of these sections are extended on
    both sides to a `minkappa` times the noise above the
