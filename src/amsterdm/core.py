"""This module contains core utilities for handling FRB data

The input data
--------------

The data is generally assumed to be a two- or three-dimensional NumPy
array of "intensity" data (simply the signal). If three-dimensional,
the central dimension is assumed to be the polarization channel, and
should have a size of 1 (only Stokes I), 2 (e.g. xx and yy) or
4. Since there is no header available for the NumPy array to indicate
what type of polarization channel(s) are included, the user will have
to pay attention to this themselves; for example, if the data is
three-dimensional Stokes I, Q, U and V data, it is probably best to
change to use only the I data, which is applicable for most cases.

The first dimension (axis 0) should be the time data, and the last
dimension (axis 1 or 2, for two- or three-dimensional data,
respectively) should be the channel / frequency data.

Other inputs often required are the frequencies (`freqs)`, which is a
list or array of frequencies, matching one-to-one with the
channels. The channels correspond to the indices into the frequency
dimension of the data, that is, the last dimension. Frequency
generally matches the channels linearly, though the relationship may
be in reverse (that is, increasing frequencies follow decreasing
channels).

The unit of frequencies is assumed to be megahertz, MHz.

The time axis, axis 0, is assumed to be linear, and the first index
(index 0) is simply assumed to be 0. The sampling time, `tsamp`, is
the time interval and is often required as an input. The unit of the
sampling time is assumed to be milliseconds, ms.

Dispersion measure, `dm`, is often input, in units of MHz^2 cm^3 pc^-1
ms; the dispersion constant, K, is set to a fixed value, of 2.41 *
10^-7 (Nimmo et al 2022, DOI:10.1038/s41550-021-01569-9), see also the
`constants` module. Since this constant, or rather 1/K, is multiplied
by `dm`, the latter can be unitless.


Units
-----

As noted above, the units assumed in the code are as follows:

- time: millisecond
- frequency: megahertz

The current version of AmsterDm does not use units internally. Future
versions may use e.g. AstroPy's `units` module for consistency and
safer calculations.

    This function takes the input data and reformats it into a
    consistent three-dimensional array. This output array may have a
    dimension of 1 for the second axis, the polarization channel axis,
    in case the input was simply two-dimensional (or three-dimensional
    with a dimension 1 second axis).

    `poltype` sets the polarization type and can be "iquv", "xy" or
    "ab", but in most cases is deduced from the input (if left at its
    default of an empty string). If the deduced polarization type does
    not match the `poltype` argument, a `ValueError` is raised.

    The input can be a two-dimensional array, a three-dimensional
    array or a dict of various polarization channels: each dict value
    is a two-dimensional array for that specific channel. The keys
    indicate the polarization type of the input, and can be matching
    keys "i", "q", "u", "v", "xx", "yy", "aa", "bb"; all format
    strings and keys are case independent. There is a minimal check
    that if "xx" is present, "yy" should be present (and vice versa),
    and the same for "aa" and "bb"; for "q", "u" and "v", there should
    at least be a "i" key present as well. From the keys, the
    polarization type is deduced, and if `poltype` is not empty, a
    check is made to see if this matches.

    If the input is three-dimensional array, the deduced polarization
    type depends on the size of the polarization channel dimension
    (the second, center, axis): if it's 1, Stokes I is assumed; if 4,
    Stokes I, Q, U and V is assumed; if 2, `poltype` should be one of
    "xy" or "ab" to give the polarization type.

    Returns
    -------
        A tuple of a three-dimensional array and a string:

    Description
    -----------

    The algorithm first smooths the light curve by using a rolling
    average with `window` size. No smoothing is done if `window` is
    negative.

    It then iteratively (up to `maxiter` times):
      - calculates a mean value
      - find all values below that mean
      - removes all non-found values (i.e., outlier peaks)

    Iteration stops when there are less than `minvalues` (default of
    10) values left or `maxiter` iterations have been reached.

    The remaining data are seen as the background. It takes the
    indices of these remaining data, and calculates a median and
    standard deviation from the non-smoothed data for this selection
    of indices; this is used as a first estimate for the background
    value and its noise.

    If the `bkg` argument is given (as two values, the median and
    standard deviation), the above calculation is skipped.

    It then finds all values in the smoothed data that are `kappa`
    times noise above the background. The relevant indices are
    combined into sections, and each of these sections are extended on
    both sides to a `minkappa` times the noise above the
    background. The latter step is done separately, so that incidental
    low-sigma spikes above the background are not included, only when
    adjacent to a larger foreground region.

    If `searchrange` is given, the above calculation is done in the
    given range.

    These sections then define the foreground area where there is an
    active light curve.

    The sections are then returned, as a list of 2-tuples with start
    and end indices.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : Array
        The one-dimensional light curve intensity data
    kappa : float, default 10
        Find peaks that are `kappa` times the noise above
    minkappa : float, default 3
        minimal noise value to be included next to the peak areas
    maxiter : int, default 10
        Maximum number of iterations to find an average (by
        iteratively removing outlier peaks).
    minvalues : int, deafult 10
        Minimum number of data points to keep when iteratively
        determining for an average
    window : integer, default 7
        number of bins to use in the rolling average. Use -1 for no
        rolling average
    searchrange : a 2-tuple of floats, default (0, 1)
        Fractional start and end of the search range. Note that the
        background calculation is odne for the full range.

    Description
    -----------

    For each channel (if available, in case of three-dimensional
    data), a background level is estimated; see `calc_background` for
    a description.  The background is subtracted from the full channel
    values, then the channel is divided (normalized) by the background
    standard deviation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : Array
        data that needs be normalised. Usually contains frequency on the y-axis
        and time samples on the x-axis.

    backgroundrange: 2-tuple of background interval, or iterable of
        2-tuples of background fraction intervals.

        Each interval is a 2-tuple that contains two floating point
        values between 0 and 1, which are the fractions of the full
        data sample (time-axis) range that contain a background
        section. All sections are combined, after which the background
        is calculated (using the median or mean value over the
        combined area).

    method : str, default="mean"
        method to estimate the background level for each channel.

        Note that "mode" is not very applicable for continuously distributed
        data; and for normally distributed data, it will be the same value as
        the median or mean.

    backgroundrange : iterable of 2-tuple of float, optional
        Fractional range along the time axis where the background
        should be measured. See `calc_background` for details.

        Set to `None` to not apply a bandpass correction (no background
        is calculated).

        The bandpass correction is calculated separately for each
        polarization (if applicable), but with identical
        `backgroundrange` s for each polarization channel.

    bkg_method: str, optional

    """Returns a dynamical spectrum with the Stokes I / intensity
    parameter from the input data data array

    The routine corrects for the given dispersion, calculates a
    background and corrects for the bandpass. Note that it does not
    flag any bad channels; these should have been flagged in the input
    data beforehand.

    When multiple polarization channels exist, it performs the above
    steps for each channel this for each independently, then combines
    the resulting dynamical spectra together into one dynamical
    spectrum.

    The data is either

    - two-dimensional, with the first dimension the time samples and
      the second dimension the frequency channels,

    - or three-dimensional, with the first dimension the time samples,
      the second dimension the polarization, and the third dimension
      the frequency channels.

    The data should contain either one or no polarization dimension;
    in the latter case this is assumed to be Stokes I. Or the data
    contains four polarization channels, of which the first two are
    assumed to be xx and yy and will be added together.

    If the dispersion `dm` is set to 0 or None, no dispersion
    correction is performed. If the `backgroundrange` is set to
    `None`, no background is calculated and no bandpass correction is
    performed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : Array or a dict of str, Array
        This is a single three-dimensional array, or a two-dimensional
        array, or a dictionary with keys of "xx" and "yy" and
        two-dimensional arrays (time and frequency) as values. For the
        three-dimensional array, the second dimension should be the
        "polarization" channel, in this case only the xx/yy data
        (i.e., of size 2).

    freqs: ndarray
        Frequencies corresponding to the data

    tsamp: float
        Sampling time in milliseconds

    dm: float
        Dispersion measure. Zero or `None` will skip the dedispersion step

    reffreq: float, option.
        Reference frequency for the dedispersion. If not given (or
        `None`), the maximum frequency from the `freqs` array is used.

    backgroundrange : iterable of 2-tuple of float, optional
        Fractional range along the time axis where the background
        should be measured. See `calc_background` for details.

        Set to `None` to not apply a bandpass correction (no background
        is calculated).

        The bandpass correction is calculated separately for each
        polarization (if applicable), but with identical
        `backgroundrange` s for each polarization channel.

    bkg_method : str, optional
        What method to use for the background calculation. One of
        "mean", "median" or "mode". See `calc_background` for details.

    combine : str
        Method to combine individual channels (if applicable). One of "mean",
        "average" (same as "mean") or "sum". Default is "mean".

    Returns
    -------

    Raises
    ------
